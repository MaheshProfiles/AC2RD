AC2RD can be built from source either using Eclipse (with ADT Plugin), or Android Studio.

Building with Eclipse (with ADT Plugin):

  - If you are behind a proxy (which is a traditional setting in a corporate environment), then you need to configure ant to use it. This is explained in the ant documentation here: http://ant.apache.org/manual/proxy.html

Building with Android Studio:
